# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open standard developed by Anthropic for connecting AI agents to external data sources, tools, and services. It provides a standardized way for agents to interact with the world beyond their training data.

## How MCP Works

MCP follows a **3-layer client-server architecture**:

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **1** | **Host** (AI App) | The AI application you use — Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, OpenClaw |
| **2** | **MCP Client** (built into Host) | Manages connections, routes requests, handles authentication |
| **3** | **MCP Servers** | Expose specific tools, resources, and prompts for agent to use |

The Agent (Layer 1) sends requests through its built-in MCP Client (Layer 2), which communicates with MCP Servers (Layer 3) that connect to real external services — filesystems, APIs, databases.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Tools** | Actions an agent can perform | Create a GitHub PR, query a database |
| **Resources** | Data an agent can read | Read a file, fetch a web page |
| **Prompts** | Pre-built templates for common tasks | "Review this PR" template |
| **Transports** | How client and server communicate | stdio (local), SSE (remote) |

## Quick Start: Add an MCP Server

To add an MCP server to your agent, add it to your agent's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart your agent and the new tools will be available automatically.
